        I own and created the alerts and strategy for Square&rsquo;s web
        checkout, which processes over $7&nbsp;billion annually for sellers all
        over the world. I have been responsible for saving customers tens of
        millions of dollars, all the while ruining Christmas, birthdays, and any
        peace and quiet you may hold dear. If I were on your team, you might
        hate what I do, but that&rsquo;s just the job description of owning
        alerts&mdash;the reality many teams face.

      <Text>Let&rsquo;s get you started on your alerting journey.</Text>

        <Text>
          Firstly, if your team does not have a DRI (Directly Responsible
          Individual&mdash;also known as &ldquo;the owner&rdquo;) for your
          alerts, you need one. You can never have accurate and quiet alerts if
          there is no one to take charge and learn from their mistakes. Better
          yet, create documentation of your journey and onboard team members to
          your alerting strategy to reduce the all-important bus factor; but in
          the end, someone must care, be responsible, and learn.

        <Text variant="h2">What to measure</Text>
        <Text>
          You may feel overwhelmed by the amount of data you need to measure.
          Should you measure application health upstream, downstream, or maybe
          memory, CPU utilization, or number of coffees ingested?
        </Text>
        <Text>
          First, back up and identify all P0 and P1
          Jobs&nbsp;To&nbsp;Be&nbsp;Done (JTBD) that are critical to your users,
          such as &ldquo;take a payment&rdquo;, &ldquo;add to cart&rdquo;,
          &ldquo;withdraw money&rdquo;. Write them all down; now for something
          controversial.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          We need to measure degradation on these JTBD; however, we should not
          measure memory usage, CPU utilization, or network throughput. Instead,
          measure the rate of successful job events&nbsp;&mdash; the ratio of{" "}
          <code>success / valid events</code>; this will often be API responses.
          CPU, memory, and the network&mdash;even if they are hard
          dependencies&mdash;don't tell you when users are actually unable to
          finish their job. Start and end with user impact; everything else is a
          distraction until you have perfected your alerts.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Ensure you capture the full flow of P0 jobs your user may need. For
          ecommerce you may have the jobs: &ldquo;page load&rdquo; → &ldquo;add
          to cart&rdquo; → &ldquo;validate order&rdquo; → &ldquo;take
          payment&rdquo;.
        </Text>
      </div>

      <div class="space-y-2">
        <Text variant="h2">How to measure</Text>
        <Text>
          Each metric from your JTBD will have different volume and
          characteristics; some may even have such low volume that you may
          consider them no longer P0. For the sake of your sanity, put these
          jobs and their metrics in a sheet and note which metrics are reliable,
          such as paying for an item, and which ones are questionable, such as
          &ldquo;add to cart&rdquo;. This sheet will inform the aggressiveness
          you can set for your alerts and should serve as your primary source of
          truth.

      </div>

      <div class="space-y-2">
        <Text variant="h2">How to alert</Text>
        <Text>
          Alerting on a metric is not about a single alert but a series of
          alerts that capture the behaviors of the metric; for example your
          alerts might be accurate during the day but noisy at night. Because of
          this, your alerts and strategies will differ from mine. However, one
          thing will always be the same.
        </Text>
        <Text variant="h3">ALERTS MUST BE ACTIONABLE</Text>
        <Text>
          If an alert goes off and there is not a slight sense of &ldquo;oh
          fuck&rdquo; the alerts are too noisy. Alerts should only fire if there
          is some action to take&mdash;whether that be fixing the alert, filing
          a bug, or declaring a SEV and getting all hands on deck.
